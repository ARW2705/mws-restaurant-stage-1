Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1 Criteria and Game Plan


Design aspects to be added (from review rubric):

  Responsive
    - all content must be responsive
    - content should make use of screen real estate
    - image title/text renders next to image in all viewport sizes
    - images are sized appropriately to viewport and don't crowd or overlap other content
    - main page restaurants and images displayed in all viewports
    - detail page includes a map, hours, and reviews in all viewports

  Accessible
    - content related images include appropriate alt text
    - focus is appropriately managed to tab to important elements of page and modals
      lock focus
    - elements use semantic elements where able and use aria roles when not

  Offline-first
    - when available, site uses a service worker to cache responses
    - visited pages are available with no network access


Notes on initial website:

  Display-
    1. text and restaurant cards on main page too narrow
    2. large, unused white space to the right of cards
    3. cards not responsive, tiny on small screens becoming overflow with edge of screen
    4. main page card layout disjointed - adjust spacing of elements
    5. map filters section disjointed and ugly
    6. review cards difficult to read - style and accentuation needed for clarity
    7. image natural dimensions are huge

  Accessibility-
    1. results from audit:
      - elements have no alt
      - frames missing title
      - drop downs missing labels
      - background/foreground contrast too low
      - html missing lang attr
    2. testing with reader:
      - nav link doesn't state where it navigates to
      - map lists all query results but no context
      - next tab is blank?
      - combo boxes missing labels
      - should result number be stated?
      - list needs label
      - list tabbing skips card info and goes straight to details button
      - list items needs label
      - navigating to review page reads a lot of info at once and starts partway
        through the page
      - doesn't tab to restaurant Info
      - doesn't tab to reviews

  Offline-first-
    1. no service worker
    2. no caching in place


Ideas for changes:
  Responsive-
    1. Basic layout/setup
      - set viewport
      - set charset
      - normalize css
      - go flexbox
    2. Deeper layout ideas
      - width breakpoints
        mobile/small - up to 600
          - main page cards vertically stacked 1 per row
        medium - 600 to 900
          - main page cards 2 per row
        large - 900+
          - main page cards add margin to center
      - adjust background color?
      - add box shadow to make cards pop and adjust component spacing
      - review cards
        - style cards to make them stand out and help separate the different
          info (name, date, rating, body)
      - review should be 1 item per row on smaller screens, 2 on larger?
    3. Images
      - create different sized images to match viewport width, currently they're
        800x600 and won't need that size/best size for different sizes

  Accessibility-
    1. Contrast
      - change text colors/backgrounds to improve contrast
    2. Focus
      - change interactive elements to highlight when in focus
      - fix focus points and order
    3. Images
      - add alt text
    4. Semantics
      - adjust html tags to semantic tags where available
      - set meta lang
    5. Reader
      - after semantics fixed, add appropriate aria

  Offline-first-
    1. add a service worker and register it properly to start
    2. need to cache assets - will likely have different image size categories,
      should they all be in the same cache or different?
